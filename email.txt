Subject: Proposal to Implement /version and /manifest.jsp Endpoints for Enhanced Deployment Visibility and Tracking

Hi [Team/All],

I hope you’re doing well.

To enhance our deployment process, improve traceability, and ensure consistent environment configurations, I’m proposing the implementation of two new endpoints that will provide critical information about our JVM instances and deployed JARs. This will align with our DevOps best practices by promoting transparency, automation, and efficient issue resolution.

1. /version or /info API Endpoint
This API will serve as a centralized way to retrieve runtime metadata for each JVM instance. It will help both developers and DevOps teams during deployments, debugging, and monitoring. Key details to include:

Name: The name of the JVM instance (e.g., app or service identifier).
Version: JVM version, useful for compatibility and upgrade tracking.
Branch: The code branch deployed (e.g., main, release, feature/*).
Commit ID: The specific commit hash deployed, ensuring traceability to the source code repository.
JVM Start Time: Timestamp indicating when the JVM started, helping with uptime monitoring.
User Started (Optional): The username or system account responsible for initiating the JVM process, useful for audit trails.
This endpoint will streamline troubleshooting by allowing us to quickly verify the running version, branch, and commit, reducing time spent identifying deployment issues.

2. /manifest.jsp API Endpoint
To further ensure deployment accuracy, this endpoint will expose detailed information about deployed JARs. It will help in verifying whether the correct artifacts have been deployed by providing:

Classpath and Library JARs: A comprehensive list of all JARs included in the runtime classpath.
Manifest Version: The version extracted from the JAR’s MANIFEST.MF, indicating the build version.
Jar Created Time: Timestamp indicating when the JAR was built, helping in identifying outdated artifacts.
Commit ID or Package Info: Linking each JAR to its corresponding commit, enhancing traceability to specific code changes.
By integrating this endpoint into our CI/CD pipeline or monitoring tools, we can automate checks for deployed JARs, reducing manual verification and minimizing the risk of deploying outdated or incorrect artifacts.

Benefits & Alignment with DevOps Practices
Increased Observability: Provides clear insights into the deployment state of JVM instances and artifacts.
Improved Traceability: Direct linkage between running code and source control commits.
Faster Debugging: Immediate access to version and artifact data for quicker issue resolution.
Deployment Verification: Automated validation of deployed components, reducing human error.
Please let me know if we should discuss this further or schedule a meeting to align on implementation details.

Best regards,
