Subject: Proposal to Implement /version and /manifest.jsp Endpoints for Enhanced Deployment Visibility and Tracking

Hi [Team/All],

I hope you’re doing well.

To enhance our deployment process, improve traceability, and ensure consistent environment configurations, I’m proposing the implementation of two new endpoints that will provide critical information about our JVM instances and deployed JARs. This will align with our DevOps best practices by promoting transparency, automation, and efficient issue resolution.

1. /version or /info API Endpoint
This API will serve as a centralized way to retrieve runtime metadata for each JVM instance. It will help both developers and DevOps teams during deployments, debugging, and monitoring. Key details to include:

Name: The name of the JVM instance (e.g., app or service identifier).
Version: JVM version, useful for compatibility and upgrade tracking.
Branch: The code branch deployed (e.g., main, release, feature/*).
Commit ID: The specific commit hash deployed, ensuring traceability to the source code repository.
JVM Start Time: Timestamp indicating when the JVM started, helping with uptime monitoring.
User Started (Optional): The username or system account responsible for initiating the JVM process, useful for audit trails.
This endpoint will streamline troubleshooting by allowing us to quickly verify the running version, branch, and commit, reducing time spent identifying deployment issues.

2. /manifest.jsp API Endpoint
To further ensure deployment accuracy, this endpoint will expose detailed information about deployed JARs. It will help in verifying whether the correct artifacts have been deployed by providing:

Classpath and Library JARs: A comprehensive list of all JARs included in the runtime classpath.
Manifest Version: The version extracted from the JAR’s MANIFEST.MF, indicating the build version.
Jar Created Time: Timestamp indicating when the JAR was built, helping in identifying outdated artifacts.
Commit ID or Package Info: Linking each JAR to its corresponding commit, enhancing traceability to specific code changes.
By integrating this endpoint into our CI/CD pipeline or monitoring tools, we can automate checks for deployed JARs, reducing manual verification and minimizing the risk of deploying outdated or incorrect artifacts.

Benefits & Alignment with DevOps Practices
Increased Observability: Provides clear insights into the deployment state of JVM instances and artifacts.
Improved Traceability: Direct linkage between running code and source control commits.
Faster Debugging: Immediate access to version and artifact data for quicker issue resolution.
Deployment Verification: Automated validation of deployed components, reducing human error.
Please let me know if we should discuss this further or schedule a meeting to align on implementation details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Subject: Proposal to Implement /version, /manifest.jsp, and /env Endpoints for Enhanced Deployment Visibility and Tracking

Hi [Team/All],

I hope you’re doing well.

To further enhance our deployment process, traceability, and post-deployment validation, I’m proposing the implementation of three new endpoints that will provide crucial information about JVM instances, deployed JARs, and runtime properties. These changes will align with our DevOps practices by promoting transparency, automation, and efficient troubleshooting across environments.

1. /version or /info API Endpoint
This endpoint will provide essential JVM runtime metadata to help developers and DevOps teams verify deployments and monitor instances. Key details include:

Name: JVM instance or service name.
Version: JVM version for compatibility tracking.
Branch: Code branch in use (e.g., main, release, feature/*).
Commit ID: The exact commit hash deployed, ensuring traceability to source control.
JVM Start Time: Timestamp for uptime monitoring.
User Started (Optional): User or system account initiating the JVM, aiding in audit trails.
2. /manifest.jsp API Endpoint
This endpoint will help verify the correct deployment of artifacts by listing JAR details. It will include:

Classpath and Library JARs: All JARs in the runtime classpath.
Manifest Version: Version from MANIFEST.MF to track builds.
Jar Created Time: JAR build timestamp for identifying outdated artifacts.
Commit ID or Package Info: Links each JAR to the corresponding commit for traceability.
Integrating this with CI/CD pipelines or monitoring tools will automate artifact verification, minimizing manual checks and reducing deployment risks.

3. /env API Endpoint
Post-deployment validation is crucial for ensuring consistent backend operations. The /env endpoint will expose all runtime properties used by the JVM, providing visibility into:

Environment Variables: Configured environment variables for the JVM.
System Properties: JVM-level properties, including database URLs, API endpoints, and feature flags.
Custom Application Configurations: Backend service configurations used in calls, which are essential for debugging and performance validation.
This endpoint will be invaluable for post-deployment checks by allowing us to confirm that the correct configuration settings are applied, especially in multi-environment deployments (e.g., staging, production).

Benefits & Alignment with DevOps Practices
Enhanced Observability: Comprehensive insights into runtime configurations, artifacts, and deployment metadata.
Improved Traceability: Direct linkage between deployed code, artifacts, and backend configurations.
Faster Debugging & Issue Resolution: Immediate access to runtime properties and deployment details.
Automated Deployment Validation: Streamlines post-deployment verification through automation and monitoring.
Let me know if we should schedule a meeting to discuss the implementation details or if further clarification is needed.
